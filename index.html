				<p class=standout>This is the story about how I lost my penny.</p>
				<p class=main>The first and most important thing to point out at the beginning of this story is that this all happened when I was no older than 8. And despite the unsanitary nature of my childhood habits, I do now give them credit for my resolute immune system.</p>
				<p class=main>When I was verry young, I loved to collect coins. If you're thinking I did this for the prurpose of making money or like a collector who cares about how old the coin is or even what kind of coin it was, you'd be wrong. I just wanted to suck on them.</p>
				<p class=standout>I would find them, put them in my mouth, and <span>suck on them</span></p>
				<p class=main>This all came to an end, however, on one of the most tragic days of my childhood. I can remember it clearly, even to this day.</p>
				<p class=main>I was in my room, minding my own beeswax and my sister came in like a snake, with the intention of scaring me. But she was not as quiet as she had indtended to be. As she closed the door, she accidently let it swing too fast and it slammed shut with a bang. In that moment, I jumped and my whole body froze. My whole body, that is, except for my throat, which took the opportunity to swollow.</p>
				<p class=standout>"My penny!" I exclaimed in sorrow and defeat.</p> 
				<p class=main>But it was too late, it was forever gone, along with my habbit of sucking on coins.</p>
